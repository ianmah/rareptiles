Gross export numbers from the CITES Trade database (<a href=\"http://www.unep-wcmc-apps.org/citestrade/report.cfm\">http://www.unep-wcmc-apps.org/citestrade/report.cfm</a>) indicate that the highest export numbers predictably are from the range countries Kenya (4,749 animals 1978-1981, 1996-1999, 2005-06, 2010 onwards) and Tanzania (19,505 animals from 1985 onwards); the export numbers from Zambia are remarkable given the small known area of occurrence (17,160 live animals exported since 1995, 6,400 in 2011 alone). Declared exports (without corresponding import records) from Mozambique (2,850 animals in 1997-1998) and Congo (DRC) (3,700 live animals 1999-2007), and a&#160; confiscation of 209 animals at Entebbe Airport, Uganda in 2000, indicate the likelihood of extensive illegal trade and corresponding complications of monitoring trade in this species and its impact on populations. As well as removing animals, collectors often destroy habitat in process of collecting, using crowbars and jacks to open suitable refuges (Klemens and Moll 1995; Spawls <em>et al</em>. 2002; Malonza 2003; Mwaya <em>et al</em>. 2018).",

      "conservativeActions":"<em>Malacochersus tornieri</em> has been listed in CITES Appendix II since 1975, regulating its international trade with the aim that such trade should not be detrimental to the survival of the species or its ecological role across its natural range. A proposal to transfer the species to Appendix I, which would have resulted in a suspension of international trade for commercial purposes, was submitted and then withdrawn at CITES CoP11 in 2000.&#160;Kenya discontinued exporting <em>M. tornieri</em> from the wild in 1981, but a few farms are authorized to breed for export. However, enforcement is a challenge and illegal collection and export of wild-collected as purportedly captive-bred specimens is highly likely since there is no established marking system. Hence, tortoise farms may act as conduits for export of wild specimens.&#160;A significant milestone in Pancake Tortoise conservation in Tanzania emerged following imposition of an export quota moratorium in 1992 (Kabigumila 1998), and allowance for the private sector to captive-breed the species for live trade demand (MNRT 1998). Currently, at least four farms have been licensed to breed the Pancake Tortoise in Tanzania (Kabigumila 1998; Mbassa and Maganga 2002). The moratorium was lifted in 2018, based on the assurances of Tanzania that there are no intentions to resume the export of specimens collected from the wild ( page 8 of <a href=\"https://cites.org/sites/default/files/eng/com/sc/70/E-SC70-29-02.pdf\">https://cites.org/sites/default/files/eng/com/sc/70/E-SC70-29-02.pdf</a>; page 54 of <a href=\"https://cites.org/sites/default/files/eng/com/sc/70/E-SC70-29-02-A2.pdf\">https://cites.org/sites/default/files/eng/com/sc/70/E-SC70-29-02-A2.pdf</a>).&#160;In Zambia, international trade in Pancake Tortoises was suspended for a while because “laundered” animals from East Africa had presumably been exported from there previously. The suspension held until the suspected presence of natural populations there was verified and its size evaluated by ZAWA (2000). However, no protection of the area known to support Pancake Tortoise populations in Zambia is provided by ZAWA (Chansa and Wagner 2006).&#160;In Tanzania, Pancake Tortoise populations have been reported from 4 of 16 gazetted national parks, namely Serengeti, Tarangire, Ruaha, and Mkomazi. National parks in Tanzania are fairly comprehensively protected and are considered ecological benchmarks (Sinclair <em>et al</em>. 2002). In Kenya, about 95% of the total <em>M. tornieri</em> population occurs outside protected areas, where the best habitat also occurs. Pancake Tortoise presence has been confirmed in the following protected areas, from south to north: Tsavo East National Park (northern sector), Kitui South, Shaba, Buffalo Springs and Samburu National Reserves, and Namunyak Wildlife Conservancy (Malonza 2003; Mwaya <em>et al</em>. 2018). It has also been recorded in some adjacent Laikipia Conservancies (Malonza, unpubl. data).&#160;Across its entire range, Bombi <em>et al</em>. (2013) estimated that only 22.6% of <em>M. tornieri</em> habitat is currently protected. The fact that a majority of the species’ populations occur outside protected areas predispose them to illegal collection for live trade as well as to anthropogenic habitat disturbance.There is a need to promote other non-exploitative economic activities and provide incentives that are linked with community enterprise and alternative livelihoods to reduce local community overexploitation of the species and destruction of its habitat or micro-habitats. There is a need for eco-friendly and sustainable-use initiatives such as eco-tourism; these can reduce the direct reliance on exploitation with environmental resources that affect the species and its habitat.",

This structure was in poor condition for over a decade until it was replaced in 2005 by a fence of much higher quality and with a mesh size that excluded pigs yet allowed iguanas to pass through and nest in historic areas. Similar exclusion fences are needed to protect inland forest nesting areas from pigs as well as goats. Fortunately, a well-attended hunting season has kept the feral goat population from expanding and the timing has been moved outside the iguana nesting and incubation seasons (Joglar <em>et al</em>. 2007, M. García pers. comm.).<br/><br/>An <em>in situ</em> headstart program was initiated in 2000 that boosted recruitment of juvenile iguanas for several years and increased the adult population (García and Gerber 2016). Despite the success of the headstart program, it was expensive and only meant to serve as a stopgap measure. Since the primary threats to Mona Rhinoceros Iguanas are invasive mammals, the focus is now on planning for their eradication. The first step toward this goal was the completion of a feasibility study to eradicate feral pigs, cats, and rats from Mona Island (Island Conservation 2013). In addition to ecological and logistical challenges, a major hurdle will be securing the estimated 8.2 million US dollars required for this necessary eradication.<br/><br/>Recent efforts to remove Australian Pine and restore iguana nesting habitat have met with initial success (Figuerola <em>et al</em>. 2018). Using chainsaws and rakes to remove all pine needle debris, six areas were cleared providing <em>ca</em> one km<sup>2</sup> of new nesting habitat for iguanas. Ten iguana nests with hatched eggshells were observed in these restored plots from the 2017 nesting season. Additional pine removals and monitoring to ensure against regrowth are planned.<br/><br/>Additional training of law enforcement personnel is needed to ensure protection of the Mona Rhinoceros Iguana. Some education and outreach materials targeting visitors are in place on the island but needs improvement. A focus in the schools on differentiating native iguanas with invasive Common Green Iguanas, and their roles in the ecosystem, would also benefit this species.",

Twenty one of 75 (28%) hunted the lizard “frequently” (Huang<em> et al</em>. 2008). At the time of the survey, one animal would sell for between 10 and 1,000 RMB (up to $164 USD). More recently, prices have increased to $800-1,500 in the US market (P. Hamilton pers. obs.), but CITES documentation suggests that very few animals are captive-bred.

Goats have been reduced, but not eliminated (T. Grant pers. obs. 2014) from northwestern Santa Cruz to protect the subpopulations of Bahía Conway and Cerro Dragón. Feral dogs were eradicated from Bahía Conway on Santa Cruz in the early 1980s to protect iguanas, and are also controlled to very low levels in southern Isabela (Phillips <em>et al</em>. 2012). Feral cats have been eradicated from Baltra and Venecia, and Black Rats from Seymour Norte (Harper <em>et al</em>. 2011, Phillips <em>et al</em>. 2012). The impact of rats is less well understood; however, it was documented that an increased number of Marine Iguana hatchlings were observed following a nearly complete eradication of Black Rats from Pinzón in 1988 (Cayot <em>et al</em>. 1994).<br/><br/>Multiple translocations of Galápagos Land Iguanas have occurred since 1932. During the Hancock Expedition (1932–33), <em>ca</em> 70 iguanas were captured from Baltra where they appeared to be malnourished, perhaps due to competition for food with introduced goats, and introduced to Seymour Norte where neither goats nor iguanas were present (Woram 1992, Cayot 2008). This experimental translocation later benefited the Baltra iguana population as they were eliminated from Baltra by 1954. Soon after the eradication of invasive mammals on Baltra, iguanas were reintroduced in 1991 (Cayot and Menoscal 1992).<br/><br/>Following the nearly complete decimation of the subpopulations at Bahía Conway (Santa Cruz) and Bahía Cartago (Isabela) by feral dogs in the mid-1970s, an iguana captive breeding programme was initiated by the Galápagos National Park Service and the Charles Darwin Research Station (CDRS), and the surviving iguanas were transferred to the CDRS on Santa Cruz. In 1977, iguanas from the CDRS were introduced to Venecia, an islet off northwestern Santa Cruz, and since it lacked proper soil an artificial nesting site was constructed. Offspring from Venecia have subsequently been translocated to nearby Cerro Dragón (Cayot <em>et al</em>. 1994). Iguanas from the CDRS were also reintroduced back to Bahía Cartago, Isabela. The iguana breeding programme at the CDRS was discontinued in 2008 (Cayot 2008).<br/><br/>In January 2019, a group of 2,150 iguanas from Seymour Norte were reintroduced to Santiago, following the eradication of feral domestic pigs in 2001 (Anonymous 2019, Kumar <em>et al</em>. 2019). If they survive and become established, this will potentially increase the area of occupancy for Galápagos Land Iguanas.<br/><br/>Conservation and research actions recommended for this species include an improved knowledge of population size and trends, distribution and habitat trends, and the impact of invasive species management. Further research and management discussions are needed concerning the results of molecular analysis by Tzika <em>et al</em>. (2008) that determined distinctions between western, central, and Plaza Sur populations, as well as individuals in the introduced Seymour Norte and Baltra populations showing a mix of Isabela and Santa Cruz ancestry due to poorly documented translocations.

Because the Galápagos is a high tourism area, it has attracted large numbers of migrants from the Ecuadorian mainland seeking tourist industry jobs. To curb population increase, Ecuador enacted a new law (Ley Orgánica de Régimen Especial para la Conservación y Desarrollo Sustentable de la Provincia de Galápagos: LOREG) requiring a special visa to visit the Galápagos, and there are strict limits on who can move there permanently (Strahm and Patry 2010).<br/><br/>Several eradication programmes have occurred in the Galápagos, including feral goats from several islands, cats from Baltra and Venecia, and Black Rats from Seymour Norte and Bainbridge #4 (Phillips <em>et al</em>. 2012). Increased efforts to eradicate or control cats, dogs, rats, and pigs to benefit all subpopulations of Marine Iguanas is sorely needed. The impact of rats is less well understood, however, it was documented that more hatchlings than normal were observed following a nearly complete eradication of Black Rats from Pinzón in 1988 (Cayot <em>et al</em>. 1994).<br/><br/>Conservation and research actions recommended for the species include an improved knowledge of population size, trends, distribution, factors limiting population size, habitat trends, and invasive species management. Some populations are of particular conservation concern and further research on the impact of low effective population size is recommended. Research to understand the impact of warming waters (climate change and El Niño) on individual algae species, along with other factors affecting algae community composition and iguana foraging dynamics, is recommended (Shepherd and Hawks 2005, Vinueza <em>et al</em>. 2006, Tomkins and Wolff 2017). An increased understanding of the effect of widespread oceanic pollution, including oil spills and micro-plastics, on Marine Iguanas and their micro-biota (which enable effective digestion) is also needed. Plastic debris ranks as one of the most abundant and persistent solid wastes at sea and shorelines, representing 25% of the total marine debris collected during beach cleanups in the Galápagos (Alava <em>et al</em>. 2014). Improved biosecurity measures to prevent disease introductions, such as West Nile Virus, avian malaria, and other are also recommended.
