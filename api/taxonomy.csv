Jouventin<em> et al.</em> (2006) found only significant genetic differentiation between the northern and southern/ eastern populations. However, Banks<em> et al.</em> (2006) identified three species, and proposed a further split of <em>E. chrysocome </em>into southern (<em>E. chrysocome</em>) and eastern (<em>E. filholi</em>) ‘species’. This was not adopted by BirdLife International on the grounds of small sample sizes and limited morphological differences between the southern and eastern forms (BirdLife International 2008). However, further research by de Dinechin <em>et al.</em> (2009) also supported the split of <em>chrysocome</em> and <em>filholi</em>.<br/>Recently, Frugone <em>et al. </em>(2018) analyzed two mtDNA (HVRI, COI) and two nuclear (ODC, AK1) markers from 13 locations of five putative Eudyptes species: rockhopper (<em>E. filholi</em>, <em>E. chrysocome</em>, and <em>E. moseleyi</em>), macaroni (<em>E. chrysolophus</em>) and royal penguins (<em>E. schlegeli</em>). They found a strong phylogeographic structure among rockhopper penguins from South America, subantarctic and subtropical islands supporting the recognition of three separate species of rockhopper penguins. Mays <em>et al.</em> (2019), on the other hand, using similar markers but different modelling also found genetic structure and low genetic flow, but in his analyses the best-supported population models for the southern rockhoppers combined <em>E. c. chrysocome</em> and <em>E. c. filholi</em> into a single lineage or 2 lineages with bidirectional gene flow, and thus proposed that they should be treated as different management units only. Lois <em>et al.</em> (2020) added new information on the southern rockhopper (<em>E. c. chrysocome</em>) from the southwest Atlantic Ocean. Studying the genetic structure of individuals from different colonies located in the southwest Atlantic they found evidence for two genetic clusters within the rockhopper, one northern (Falkland/ Malvinas Islands and Isla Pingüino) and one southern (Terhalten and Staten Island)."

22697805,184753545,Eudyptula minor,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,SPHENISCIFORMES,AVES,SPHENISCIDAE,Eudyptula,minor,Least Concern,,,,"(Forster, 1781)","A first review of the evidence resulted in the following commentary:Waugh (2016, Notornis 63: 66-72) presents evidence from barcoding of a considerable genetic distance between all New Zealand populations of Little Penguin and all Australian ones. However, the problem with this paper, which does not directly attempt to establish the two populations as two species (but is strongly pressing for this), is that it fails even to mention the paper referred to in the Checklist text on the species (Banks <em>et al.</em> 2008), which found a different configuration, with birds from Otago, in south-east New Zealand, grouping with the Australian clade. On the basis of this omission alone Waugh’s proposal cannot be taken seriously. However, it is worth noting that both Banks <em>et al. </em>(2008, New Zealand J. Zool. 35: 265–270) and Waugh (2016) found no real support for any subspecific divisions in Little Penguin other than that involving the two clades (the white-flippered form, recognised as <em>albosignata</em> in the Checklist, is described as a ‘morphotype’), and even then there is no clear morphological characterisation by which the two clades could be distinguished. This circumstance is redolent of the situation of the two clades of Common Redstart <em>Phoenicurus phoenicurus </em>mentioned in the introduction to Checklist 1: the clades exist, and are deep, but are of no taxonomic consequence or significance.<br/>This commentary was written in ignorance of a series of papers by Grosser et al. (2015, PLoS ONE 10: e0144966; 2016, Proceedings of the Royal Society of London Series B 283: 20152879&#160; http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2015.2879; 2017, Emu 117: 276-283). However, these three studies, while intriguing, do not build an entirely compelling argument to overturn the conclusion above. Alongside two that they cite (Macey <em>et al.</em> 2015, New Zealand J. Zool. 42: 33-34; Miyazaki &amp; Nakagawa 2015, Acta Ethol. 18: 227-234), the papers determine that the two taxa cannot be told apart but•	the populations are genetically distinct;•	the Australian birds indeed have an outpost nested on the east side of NZ between populations of NZ birds;•	there is limited hybridisation between the ‘Australian outpost’ and NZ birds;•	only Australian birds ‘raft’ before coming ashore, including in New Zealand;•	Australian birds are commonly (but not always) double-brooded (including in New Zealand), NZ birds never;•	some ultraviolet (UV) colour characteristics are different: ‘we found a significant difference between clades for UV chroma (proportion of brightness in UV range), blue chroma (proportion of brightness in blue range), and hue (wavelength of maximum reflectance peak’ (Macey <em>et al. </em>2015);•	there are average differences in skeletal characters;•	the taxa appear to be able to tell each other apart vocally, but only two populations were sampled and the sample was small (Miyazaki &amp; Nakagawa 2015).Consequent on this last point, Peter Boesman was asked to consider the vocal distinctiveness of the two clades. In an extensive report which drew on publicly available recordings of Little Penguins from other colonies than the two studied by Miyazaki &amp; Nakagawa (2015) he found little support for vocal differences between the clades:In the most 'open-minded' view the maximum score that could be given for vocal difference by application of Tobias criteria is score 2 (given that phrase length clearly is much more variable than suggested by M&amp;N), with reference to this peer-reviewed paper. We must however realize that this study only compared two colonies and not the two species groups. The latter has not been investigated, and the present preliminary 'quick and dirty' check with limited available recordings could not immediately confirm overall vocal differences between the two groups.<br/>Clearly a circumstance of extraordinary biological interest has emerged in south-east New Zealand, but it is much less clear that two species can confidently be said to be involved. It certainly appears that some factor or combination of factors is preventing the two clades from rapidly merging, but the distinguishing characters that have been documented so far do not amount to incontrovertible evidence of speciation. Either there is some as-yet undiscovered mechanism such as olfaction keeping them apart or there remains the possibility that the populations are in fact slowly merging or at least, like the Common Redstarts referred to above, capable of producing entirely viable offspring when they interbreed. In checking Macey <em>et al. </em>(2015) the paper by Clark<em> et al. </em>(2015, New Zealand J. Zool. 42: 33) was found to contain the following text:	'Given the deep genetic divergence of these clades within this species, we are exploring mate choice in mixed-clade colonies to determine whether pairing between clade members is random or whether individuals show patterns of assortative or disassortative mating… We collected DNA from focal individuals at two mixed-clade colonies in Oamaru, New Zealand. Our initial sample of 100 pairs resulted in too few New Zealand-only individuals (13 of 200) to allow statistical analyses. Consequently, we are continuing to collect additional DNA samples at the Oamaru colonies.'<br/><br/>But were the 13 NZ birds all mated with Australian birds or did they form six NZ pairs with just one mated disassortitavely? Further results of this important line of research, which might help decide a choice between the two options, appear to be unpublished. In their absence, given the poor evidence of vocal distinctiveness between the clades, and the weakness of other evidence (other than genetics) to distinguish them with certainty, a move to split the clades as two species appears premature. Moreover, the logic of the findings being discussed is that <em>Eudyptula minor</em> becomes monotypic."
